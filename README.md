For intermediate planning of a countryâ€™s goal to decrease CO2 emissions, more precision in short-term forecasts is essential. To make an informed decision, critical climate change summits need precise estimates of member nations' future potential emissions. Time series analysis using the Matrix Profile (MP) algorithm offers potential insight into motif and discord identification, behaviour characterisation, and prediction by using motifs to aid algorithms in forecasting CO2 emissions. In this study, we examine the annual amount CO2 emissions of multiple countries simultaneously to highlight instances if time series are adhering to a certain behaviour and, as a result, identifying series within the set under consideration that does not demonstrate this behaviour. Additionally, we forecast multiple univariate time series of the yearly CO2 emissions of specific high emission countries as well as Europe to predict if they adhere to newly introduced 2030 Climate Target Plan measures to reduce carbon emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels.
